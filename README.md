MachineLearning
===============

My solutions to programming exercise for Andrew Ng's machine learning class.

The dataset for checking programs would be in the folder *data*.

Matrix tool is simple matrix class using for other machine learning algorithms.

Folder *test* is a python test tool based on matploit and numpy, which is useful and helps me directly find out whether the algorithm works or not.

Algorithm list
==============

* Linear regression -- Batch gradient descent
* Linear regression -- Stochastic gradient descent
* Locally weighted linear regression
* Logistic regression
